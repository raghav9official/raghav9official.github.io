hmm,
So this is the privacy policy of my website...
User data is collected and stored in cookies encrypted...
I do not log this data anywhere else...
I just want the name and the email id of tue person so that I can contact him/her
That's it.
Anddd I DO NOT even sell it to third parties...
This data is stored on the client side only and only...
Again in an encrypted manner..
